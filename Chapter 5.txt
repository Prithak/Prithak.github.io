Chapter 5:
A new form?
===============================================================================================================================================================
Then after the light started coming out of Krieza. He busted out from the distance and had like a golden form which was roughly 2 times stronger that the last one. Sakrot got scared
 of Krieza and then thought, “Can a guy really be this strong? I will have to risk it”.

Krieza: What you scared or something?
Suppo-Man: Scared? Huh let’s see what you can do about THIS!
Krieza: Huh?
Suppo-Man: SAIOKEN TIMES 3. (In his mind), “I can’t hold this power for long I have to destroy him right NOW!”
Krieza: What you are doing doesn’t make any sense to me.
 Suppo-Man: AAAHHHH! STOP TALKING TRASH AND COME FIGHT ME!

Then Suppo-Man got literally dashing at Krieza at the speed of light! Krieza couldn’t see a thing. Then after that Suppo-Man got at the back of Krieza and threw a blast at him. It did a
huge damage to Krieza. Then again got at front of Krieza and again threw a blast at him. Then he got at the top and PUNCHED Krieza at the head. Then suddenly his body got trembling. 
He said in his mind, “Gosh dang it I cannot hold this much power for much longer I will have to defeat him FAST and QUICK”. 

Krieza: YOU BASTARD HOW ARE YOU OVERPOWERING ME I AM THE STRONGEST IN THE UNIVERSE!
Suppo-Man: I SAID STOP TALKING TRASH!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! TAKE THIS!!!!!
Then Suppo-Man used A HUGE BLAST at Krieza. Then Suppo-Man’s body was trembling sooooooo much! He thought, “DAMN I HAVE TO STOP THIS NOW OR MY BODY WILL EXPLODE” Then
he got to his normal self. Then Krieza came in really injured.

Krieza: DAMN YOU ARE STRONG BUT I WILL DESTROY THIS WORLD NO MATTER WHAT!
Suppo-Man: NO YOU DON’T!
Then Krieza got a little red thing on his hand and threw it at earth. Suppo-Man tried to stop it but it failed! Thus, the earth was destroyed.
Suppo-Man: Oh my god. YOU…..YOU…..YOU…..HEAR….HEARTLESS….LITTLE……CREATURE.
Suppo-Man: YOU……YOU….YOU WILL PAY……YOU WILL PAY IN BLOOOODDDD.  
Krieza: What the heck is happening?
Suppo-Man: YOU…… YOU WILL PAY FOR THHHHHHIIIIIISSSS!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!
Then Suppo-Man grew some red hair suddenly and then busted out of ANGER. He was approximately 30 times stronger than his normal self.
Suppo-Man: FACE MY RAGE! KRIEZAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!
Krieza: I am freaking dead now!
