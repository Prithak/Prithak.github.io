AUTHOR:
Sorry for not posting anything lately.. I have been..... busy......

Thank you for reading....


Last time:
GOD: Oh no He's awake again? Dammit now how can we save 1 planet from his destruction? *Idea pops up* Suppo-Man!
ZEERUS: Who's this Suppo-Man your talking about?
GOD: (Turns back scared) Zeerus?
ZEERUS: Yeah it's me now *YAWN* I want to visit this Suppo-whatever guy.
GOD: But.. But..
ZEERUS: STOP YOUR BLABBERING AND GET ME THERE ALREADY
GOD: Ok!

EARTH:
Everything was still in peace. Everyone was living a really happy life. Until a new threat was going to appear. Sakrot sensed something. Then the god appeared.
SAKROT: Who's this cat-like looking guy?
ZEERUS: (In his mind) This is the respect he gives to a god? How rude.......
GOD: SAKROT!!! WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS?????
SAKROT: What the hell 'yer talking about?
ZEERUS: *ANGRY*
GOD: SAKROT! **whispers** he is the god of destruction the MOST POWERFUL BEING IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE.
SAKROT: WHHHHAAAAATTTT?????? *Exaggarated* I...I am sorry Lord Zeerus for my bad manners. I didn't know who you were......
ZEERUS: (In his mind) His energy.... seems.... familier
ZEERUS: Oh!I don't mind that! Well...

Zeerus looks around looking for something..

ZEERUS: Is there any food around in this world or not? If not! I will destroy this world..
SAKROT: Uhh... Yeah! You can get food anywhere.
ZEERUS: Really? Then go get me something

Then Sakrot got Zeerus a bag of Doritos. Then Zeerus ate one piece.... Then he like LITERALLY FELT IN LOVE WITH IT (Doritos are really like that xD)

ZEERUS: WHAT THE HECK!! THIS IS THE MOST DELICIOUS THING I HAVE EVER EATEN!!!!
SAKROT: Eh...???
ZEERUS: Uhh....... *Keeps on eating..*
SAKROT To GOD: Hey! Isn't he the guy who destroyed my planet right??
GOD: Actually! No! There are total of 4 Gods of destructions and 4 Gods and 1 Supreme God.
SAKROT: This might be a random question but why 4,4 Gods and Gods of Destructions? And also Who are Supreme Gods?
GOD: This universe is divided in four quadrants... One quadrant is ruled by one God of Destruction and One God each. Supreme Gods are the highest ranking gods.
Even stronger than the God of Destruction. They are there to make the balance or stop the God Of Destruction from over-destroying things or the Gods not even
making planets. So, the God or God of Destruction who are careless and aren't doing there work correctly the they are erased and new ones are brought.....
SAKROT: Wow.... The system is strict. By the way! How many years have you ruled?
GOD: I have ruled for 7797 years.
SAKROT: WOW!!! YOU MUST BE REALLY GOOD AT YOUR JOB.
GOD: I guess... lol.
ZEERUS: AAAHHHH! Finally finished eating this delicious confection!1
SAKROT: Oh and by the way Zeerus sir! Why are you here for?
ZEERUS: I was actually here to destroy your planet..
SAKROT: NANI??(What?)
ZEERUS: But after you gave me this delicious confection I won't!
SAKROT: Thank's god.
ZEERUS: But there is one thing I will take in return. Wait... oh.... Give and Take..
SAKROT: What do you mean?
ZEERUS: Give you power and take a fight!
SAKROT: Huh?
