Chapter 3:
The Heartless Krieza and The god?
=======================================================================================================================================================

Then after Suppo-Man reflected the most powerful blast Rakrot had. Rakrot nearly died.

Rakrot: So, there was a reason why dad chose you over me. But still you will DIE!
Suppo-Man: What?
Rakrot: I sent all what has happened to the space conquerer Krieza with whom I've been working with! He has a power level of 7 Million.
Suppo-Man: WHHHHAAATTT?
Rakrot: Krieza is heartless. He will kill everyone who interuppted him including his family
Suppo-Man: Gosh this guy must be tough
Rakrot: And he has headed for this planet right now! He will reach here in 6 months!
Suppo-Man(In mind): God this is bad!

Then sadly Rakrot passed away.

Suppo-Man: A power level of 7 million? The highest I encountered in earth was 206 and this guy was at 1 million and yet he was hard to defeat. What should I
do?
Suppo-Man: I need to find someone to train me and quick!
???: Suppo-Man!
Suppo-Man: Wait! Where is this sound coming from?
???: Listen I am a god.
Suppo-Man: A god? I thought they were just speculation of human beings.
God: Leave that behind, I can't really give you power with magic but you can come here and train with me and I can give you a power boost!
Suppo-Man: GREAT! But can you teleport me there?

Then The god teleports Suppo-Man to a really heavenly place.

God: So your really hard training begins today!
Suppo-Man: Alright!

AFTER 6 MONTHS

God: You recieved many techniques from me which are Saioken, Spirit Bomb, High Speed and High Durability. Now you are nearly perfect to fight Krieza.
Suppo-Man: One question! What is my max power level?
God: It's 6 million.
Suppo-Man: I see, so I am still not capable of defeating him.
God: But there is a possiblility that you can win.
Suppo-Man: Huh (On mind) He knows everything. So, I will surely win this fight I am coming Krieza!
