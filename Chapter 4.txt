Chapter 4:

The battle is finally going to take place! Krieza is a strong foe!
===========================================================================================================================================================================
Then after that Suppo-Man got to Earth and waited for Krieza. Then he sensed a bad energy coming out from the earth in the space. Then Suppo-Man flew up to space and saw that a kind of
 small guy was sitting on a chair like floating vehicle. Then Suppo-Man asked.
Suppo-Man: Who the hell are you?
Krieza: Me? I am Krieza the space emperor.
Suppo-Man: You must not destroy this planet!
Krieza: And why would I do that?
Suppo-Man: Because I will kill you if you do.
Krieza: You and Killing Me.*LAUGHS HARD* you...You killing me? HAHAHAHA what a joke!
Suppo-Man: This is not a joke you idiot!
Then Suppo-Man checked his power level (He learned it from the god) and it was only a million.
Suppo-Man: Hey, Krieza
Krieza: What?
Suppo-Man: I thought your power level was 7 million but it turned out to be only a million?
Krieza: Want me to show then?
Then Krieza Screamed hard and then increased his power level exponentially. His power level got to 7 million!
Suppo-Man: So this is your true power huh? Time we start fighting!
At his point Krieza destroyed Suppo-Man like he was nothing but then something happened.  Suppo-Man said “SAIOKEN” then his power, speed and attack got multiplied. Krieza got scared about 
that but still fought. Then Suppo-Man Punched Krieza at his face. Krieza got flying to the other side. After that Suppo-Man teleported there and punched Krieza down to the surface. Then again
 Suppo-Man got down and kept on punching Krieza until he warmed out. Suppo-Man said, “I won’t be able to hold this Saioken for long time, I have to destroy him now”. Then Suppo-Man threw
a huge blast at Krieza and then he got covered in rock. Krieza came out of the rock.
Krieza: So this is your real power but still nothing compared to me. LOL
Suppo-Man: Wait What?
Krieza: Let me show you what I got! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Then Krieza was screaming for a long time! Then suddenly after some time of him screaming, there came light from his body. Suppo-Man got curious about what the heck was happening there but 
he knew for sure that his power level is increasing WAAAYYYY TO HIGH!
CHAPTER 4 END
