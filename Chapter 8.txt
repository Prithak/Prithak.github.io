Chapter 8
The Destruction Fight! Sakrot vs. Zeerus
------------------------------------------
EARTH: 
ZEERUS: Yup! I want you to fight me.
SAKROT: But Why? I don't stand a chance!
ZEERUS: That's why I talked about giving you Divine Power or Energy. Now show me your highest transformation...
SAKROT: Huh? OK! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

Then Sakrot turned into his red haired form.

SAKROT: I call this Super Sakrot RED....
ZEERUS: **In his mind** Why does his energy seem so familier.

Then Sakrot got back to his original form.

ZEERUS: You are not as strong as I anticipiated.
SAKROT: Considering you are the strongest force in this quadrant.
ZEERUS: Oh! Right! Time to give you power.

Then Zeerus got his hand at Sakrot and threw some kind of energy ball at him. Then Sakrot turned a MILLION TIMES STRONGER..

SAKROT: Wow! I fell SUPER POWERFUL.
ZEERUS: Right? You have the power of a god.
SAKROT: Wait! Are you serious? I am a GOD????
ZEERUS: Yup! Now then that's settled then come at me!
SAKROT: Sure!
**intese music comes**

Then Sakrot rushes at Zeerus trying to punch him. Then Zeerus easily blocks it.

ZEERUS: Seems like you are still getting the hang of it.
SAKROT: *Nods*

Then they go up to the sky. And throw many punches at each other.

Random Person on Earth: What the hell is going on?
Another Random Person: Is this a earthquake or something?
GOD: If this fight goes on like this then the earth, no the solar system. AW HECK NO! THE UNIVERSE COULD END.

Then Zeerus came close to Sakrot and said:
ZEERUS: I know you are still holding back! Give me your full power!
SAKROT: ...

Then they keep on fighting. One throwing a punch,kick heck even bites at each other. XD

GOD: Do they HAVE to keep up this fight. Might as well make a energy field to ensure security.

Then the god made a protective area around them.

ZEERUS: You are no match for me.
SAKROT: Huh?
ZEERUS: I see you holding back. But I won't. TASTE MY FULL POWER!
SAKROT: Dang it!

Then when Zeerus punched Sakrot he teared the whole earth into two parts by falling into the ground.
Luckily god fixed it. But the fight still continued on space.

ZEERUS: Here's my final blow.... FINAL....... FALISH!!!!!!!

Luckily Sakrot dodged it.

SAKROT: Man! That was serious. It could blow my entire body up. 

Then Zeerus came out of nowhere and punchd Sakrot.

ZEERUS: You were way open there!
SAKROT: Heh? It is actually hard for me to stay on my guard all the time.
ZEERUS: Haha! That can become your disadvantage.
SAKROT: Aahh!

Then we find out that Sakrot was punched by Zeerus in the stomach. Then he fell down to the earth. We find him in the sea drowning.

SAKROT: Zeerus...... I ..... I won't..... I won't let..... I won't let you down......

Then Sakrot somehow healed his wound and came back up to Zeerus feeling well fine and good as new.

ZEERUS: I didn't know giving you divine energy will give you healing powers. (In his mind) Wait that's familier too..
SAKROT: Hah! Honestly I didn't expect this too. Divine Energy is Awesome!
ZEERUS: I know! (In his mind) Oh! I remember now! He was Torkas. But why does it seem familier?
ZEERUS: Hey! Do you know someone named Torkas?
SAKROT: Huh? No! Why did you ask and who is he?
ZEERUS: I asked you because your energy seems similar to him.
SAKROT: Huh?
ZEERUS: He was the biggest threat I ever experienced........
SAKROT: Wait! You mean he was even stronger than you?
ZEERUS: Not only me but all the gods of destructions power combines couldn't defeat him.
SAKROT: Wow! He sure must have been strong! Then how did you defeat him?
ZEERUS: The Supreme God did!
SAKROT: Oh!
