<h1> Earth </h1>
<p> It is our home planet. It is on the goldilocks zone where it is nor too hot so water evaporates and nor too cold where water freezes. It takes 365 days to revolve around sun and 24 hours to rotate on it's axis. It is only the known planet where life is possible because of it's presence of suitable atmosphere. </p>
<p> That's all </p>
