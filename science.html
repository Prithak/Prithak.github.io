a. If a bus travels 6 km in 10 minutes, what distance does it travels in 1 second? [Ans: 10 m]
	Given,
	Distance 1 (d1) = 6 km
		     = 6 x 1000 m
		     = 6000 m.
	
	Time Taken(t) = 10 minutes
			 = 10 x 60 sec
			 = 600 sec
			 
	Distance 2 (d2) = ?
	
	We know,
	
	d2 = d1/t
	   = 6000m/600 sec
	   = 10 m/s

	   
	   
	   
b. Find the average speed of a car if it travels 18 km in 20 minutes. [Ans: 15 m/s]
	Given,
	Distance (d) = 18 km
	             = 18 x 1000 m
				 = 18000 m
	Time Taken (t) = 20 min
                   = 20 x 60 sec
				   = 1200 sec
				   
	Average Speed (s) = ?
	
	We know,
	
	s = d/t
	  = 18000 / 1200
	  = 15 m/s
	  

c. How much time does a train take to travel 1800 km if its velocity is 90 km/hr? [Ans: 72000 sec]
	Given,
	Distance (d) = 1800 km
				 = 1800 x 1000 m
				 = 1800000 m
	Velocity (v) = 90 km/hr
	             = 90 km x 1000 m / 1 x 60 x 60 min
				 = 90000 m / 3600 sec
				 = 25 m/s
	
	Time taken (t) = ?
	We know,
	t = d/v
	  = 1800000 / 25
	  = 72000 sec
	  
d. A bus starting from rest has an acceleration of 0.1 m/s<sup>2</sup>. What will be the velocity of the bus after 20 seconds? [Ans: 2 m/s]
	Given,
	Initial Velocity (u) = 0
	Acceleration (a) = 0.1 m/s<sup>2</sup>
	Time Taken (t) = 20 sec
	Final Velocity (v) = ?
	
	We know,
	v = u + at
	  = 0 + 0.1 x 20
	  = 0 + 2
	  = 2 m/s
	  
e. Two vehicles are moving in the same direction. The velocity of the first vehicle is 8 m/s and second is 5 m/s. Find their relative velocity. What will be the relative velocity if they moved in the opposite directions? [Ans: 3 m/s, 13 m/s]
	Given,
	Velocity of First Vehicle (V<sub>A</sub>) = 8 m/s
	Velocity of Second Vehicle (V<sub>B</sub>) = 5 m/s
	
	Relative velocity if they are moving in same direction:
	
	Relative Velocity = V<sub>A</sub>-V<sub>B</sub>
                      = 8 m/s - 5 m/s
                      = 3 m/s
					  
	Relative Velocity if they are moving in opposite Direction:
	
	Relative Velocity = V<sub>A</sub>+V<sub>B</sub>
	                  = 8 m/s + 5 m/s
					  = 13 m/s

g. A car is travelling in the velocity of 20 m/s. After 30 sec it covers a distance of 1200 m. Calculate the acceleration of the car and final velocity of the car. [Ans: 1.33 m/s<sup>2</sup>, 60 m/s]
	Given,
	Initial Velocity(u) = 20 m/s
	Time Taken (t) = 30 sec
	Distance(d) = 1200 m
	Acceleration(a) = ?
	Final Velocity(v) = ?
	
	We know,
	d = u + v * t / d
	1200 = 20 + v x 30 / 2
	1200 = 300 + v x 15
	1200 - 300 = 15v
	900 / 15 = v
	60 m/s = v 
	
	Again,
	a = v-u/t
	  = 60 - 20 / 30
	  = 40 / 30
	  = 1.33 m/s<sup>2</sup>

h. A truck starts to move from rest. If it gains the acceleration of 3 m/s<sup>2</sup> in 5 sec, calculate the final velocity and distance covered by the truck. [Ans: 15 m/s, 37.5m]
	Given,
	Initial Velocity (u) = 0
	Acceleration (a) = 3 m/s
	Time Taken (t) = 5 sec
	Final Velocity (v) = ?
	Distance (d) = ?
	
	We know,
	v = u + at
	  = 0 + 3 x 5
	  = 0 + 15
	  = 15 m/s
	  
	Again,
	d = u + v x t / t
	  = 0 + 15 x 5 / 2
      = 15 x 5 / 2
      = 75 / 2
      = 37.5 m

a. A lever is used to lift a load of 1200 N. It was raised through a distance if 3m by applying an effort of 400 N through a distance of 12m. Calculate MA,VR and Efficiency. [3, 4, 75%]
	Given,
	Load (L) = 1200 N
	Load Distance (LD) = 12m
	Effort (E) = 400 N
	Effort Distance (ED) = 3m
	MA = ?
	VR = ?
	Efficiency = ?
	
	We know,
	MA = L/E 
	   = 1200 / 400
	   = 3
	VR = LD/ED
	   = 12 / 3
	   = 4
	Efficiency = MA / VR * 100%
	           = 75%
