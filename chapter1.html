Chapter 1:
Sakrot's Arrival
=====================================================================================================================================================
Once upon a time in a planet called Samek was in the evil eyes of Lord Zeerus, The god of destruction who destroys over populated planets.            
The we see Sakrot who was unbelievably strong child whose power level gone up to 7000 when he was 2 years, which for a child was really              
really high.(Reader Note: Power Level means fighting level, or how much power they have) Like eveyone was scared of what he will turn into
when he was a adult. We see his dad getting in the space launch panel and sent Sakrot into a planet called Earth considering he was special,
unlike other childs. Sakrot left the planet and it got destroyed. After 8 days Sakrot arrived on the planet Earth. Their race was able to 
survive with only oxygen and water, they didn't need any food to survive, luckily Sakrot knew that he had to drink water to live. So, he 
survived really easily on that planet. And there was one speciality on this race. That was they had a huge kind heart and the will to fight
and they also get stronger as they fight. Enough explaining let's get to the story then shall we?

AFTER 18 YEARS

Sakrot's a fully grown up man fighting crime on the planet earth, he got really close to the planet and said that he will protect this pla-
net even if that taked my life. Many people called him Suppo-Man so his name got to be Suppo-Man on earth because he didn't remember anyth-
ing from planet Samek

FAR AWAY IN THE GALAXY

Sakrot's older brother Rakrot didn't have kind heart and wanted to conquer the entire universe, he is still alive because he escaped himself
because he was 5 years old and was self-conscious about wahr was going to happen. There are currently 5 Samekians alive who had escaped the 
destruction of Planet Samek and were the strongest of the universe. Once Rakrot found out about his younger brother and got to his planet.

Rakrot(After getting to planet Earth): So this is Planet Earth where my younger brother was sent to, I am still angry that my father chose
to make him escape rather than me. Anyways conquering the universe will be way more easier with his help, guess I should go meet him.
