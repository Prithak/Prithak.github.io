Chapter 9
Vs. The Strongest Among Quadrants!
-----------------------------------

EARTH:
SAKROT: So you mean he is really the strongest among the whole universe huh?
ZEERUS: Yeah! And for some reason your energy seems to be similar to him.
SAKROT: Oh yeah.... what should I do about it?
ZEERUS: You shouldn't probably let it loose because the other gods of destructions might think that you are the re-incarnation of Torkas.
SAKROT: Yeah probably.....
ZEERUS: Coming to think about it..... you actually might be the re-incarnation of Torkas. Wait right here let me ask....

Then Zeerus flew off to somewhere..

INSIDE SAKROT'S BODY:
TORKAS: Eh? It's already been 20 years? Time Flies. Well time to get back to the world and take my revenge.

Sakrot screamed while Torkas coming out of his body...

SAKROT: Who the Heck are you?
TORKAS: ME? Haha! I used your body to be ressurected and as a thank you my name is Torkas.
SAKROT: Wait? Are you serious?
TORKAS: Muahahaha! You don't know me do you!
SAKROT: *Groaning.....*
TORKAS: I am the most dangerous non-god being whom NOT EVEN GOD OF DESTRUCTIONS CAN DEFEAT.. And my ultimate goal is to rule over all the quadrants.
SAKROT: To do that! You will have to fight me!
TORKAS: Eh? What the hell can you do to me! Heck! You don't even have divine ki HAHAHAHAHA!
SAKROT: Well! You thought wrong!
TORKAS: NANI?(What?)
SAKROT: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!

Then Sakrot screamed Really really loudly and the whole freaking earth was shaking.....

TORKAS: What the...... What the heck is this?
GOD: Now what?

Then God flew to Sakrot and Torkas and saw Torkas.

GOD: Wait.... You gotta be kidding me...... IS THAT TORKAS?????

Then Zeerus comes in and sees Torkas there.

ZEERUS: I knew it was too late
GOD: What do you mean?
ZEERUS: The soul of Torkas wasn't there in the underworld nor was his body and evidence states that he was living under Sakrot's body to gain enough energy to be ressurected. But What is Sakrot doing there screaming?

SAKROT: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Then suddenly Sakrot's hair gone turning blue and much more longer than his original Super Sakrot form.

TORKAS: You done there?
SAKROT: This is my strongest yet form.
ZEERUS: You mean he was holding back this much power?
GOD: Considering he has way too much potential he might even be stronger then you Lord Zeerus.
ZEERUS: My gosh! Dang it! Why did I have to give him divine ki? Now I have to retire from this job...........
TORKAS: I didn't think you would have this much power level but still you are no match for me!
SAKROT: Huh? Let's see.... if you can handle THIS....

Then he charged at Torkas and teleported to his backwards to puch him right in the head but Torkas blocked it with his hands. Sakrot was surprised at how strong he was.

SAKROT: What? You blocked that like it was nothing!
TORKAS: *Grins* What did you think, (Then he threw Sakrot to the ground) I am the strongest in the all 4 quadrants. A mere mortal like you can never defeat me!
SAKROT: WHAT? I WILL NEVER DEFEAT YOU? DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!
SAKROT: THIS IS MY PRIDE, MY HOPE, MY DESIRE TO KILL EVERY SINGLE LIKES OF YOU IN THIS UNIVERSE. AND YOU ALSO ARE MY STRONGEST ENEMY.

Then he turned his hand to him making a blast will a freak lot of energy.

SAKROT: I DIDN'T, I CAN'T AND I WON'T GIVE UP WHAT MY PURPOSE IS..... WHY I WAS BORN STRONGER THAN OTHER SAMEKIANS. TO PROTECT THIS WORLD FROM DESTRUCTION. I WILL KILL EVERY SINGLE CELLS YOU...
TORKAS: Alright! Give it your all.....
SAKROT: HERE'S EVERYTHING WITHIN MY POWERS. ULTIMATE KILLING BLASTER

Then He Blasted the Blast at Torkas. 

TORKAS: Oh Shit!

But lucky for Torkas he was able to block himself jujust in time...

TORKAS: Oh man! If that would have hit me I would be gone for sure!
SAKROT: DANG IT!!

Then Zeerus comes in to fight Torkas thinking that Sakrot would probably faint after that blast.

ZEERUS: You may be stronger than me but please let me handle this thing.
SAKROT: Ok....
ZEERUS: Wait... Use your healing powers..
SAKROT: Oh... K!

Then Sakrot healed himself and was fit to fight again. And then from nowhere came all the gods of destructions from all the quadrants.

SAKROT: Wait? Where did they come from?
KEERUS(1st Quadrant G.O.D): Who is this guy?
BEERUS(2nd Quadrant G.O.D): Yeah Who is it Zeerus?
FEERUS(3rd Quadrant G.O.D): Just Tell us already... He seems to have divine ki...
ZEERUS: Well..... I gave him divine ki and he is the strongest one in this quadrant.
BEERUS: Then your work as a God of Destruction is over....
ZEERUS: Yeah..... Sadly
SAKROT: Can anyone tell me who are they?
ZEERUS: They are all the God of Destructions from all the quadrants..
