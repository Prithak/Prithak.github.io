Chapter 6:
Krieza's Death
==============================================================================================================================================================
Then after Suppo-Man got his new form, He bursted out in his complete anger state not even remembering who he was and he was kicking Krieza so hard no one
ever imagined that one could be this strong.

Then Suppo-Man kept on attacking him for literally a hour. Then he finally died. Then he got back to his final state. And he fainted. He got teleported to the
god's holy place and was healed completely by the god. Then Suppo-Man woke up and said:

Suppo-Man: All of it is gone not even single one of the species I loved is remaining. (Crying) What the heck can I do now?
God: Don't cry I will fix all of this.
Suppo-Man: But How?
God: I can reverse time since I am a god and because you already have this form then you can defeat him without any hesitations
Suppo-Man: (Rubbing his tears) You can really do that?
God: Yup I sure can!
Suppo-Man: (Angrily) THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR DO IT ALREADY!!!
God: Isn't this a bit disrespectful for a god?
Suppo-Man: Sorry!

Then God rewinded time and then Suppo-Man got to the point where Krieza came but he had the same body and the same power of transformation. So he instantly
transformed and punched Krieza. Since he was in his first form which was really weak, He died in the 3rd Punch. Thus, the earth remained the same.

2 Years Time Skip

Since Suppo-Man was living in the culture of the earth, he married a girl named Emma. She had a really good personality and was really sincere. Further more
they are going to have a baby. Peace was like ever lasting on Planet Earth. Or so they thought. Far far away in the same galaxy there was a threat arising
on planet Earth. Zeerus the Destroyer has just woke up from an 20 Year sleep. The God instantly recognized it and became scared.

God: Oh no He's awake again? Dammit now how can we save 1 planet from his destruction? *Idea pops up* Suppo-Man!
Zeerus: Who's this Suppo-Man your talking about?
God: (Turns back scared) Zeerus?
Zeerus: Yeah it's me now I want to visit this Suppo-whatever guy.
God: But.. But..
Zeerus: STOP YOUR BLABBERING AND GET ME THERE ALREADY
God: Ok!

Then God teleported Zeerus to Suppo-Man
